This repository contains practical demonstrations of VisPy that require data 
files too large to include in the main repository. To add a contribution,
adhere to the following guidelines:

* Demos should be unique, attrictve, and exhibit some non-trivial functionality 
  provided by VisPy.

* Each demo (or group of demos) should have its own top-level directory that
  includes the following:

      1. A LICENSE.txt file that applies to all contents of the directory
      2. An AUTHORS.txt file that gives proper attribution to the creators of
         the demonstration data as well as the source code. Relevant 
         publications, if applicable, should be cited.
 
* Although this repository is expected to contain large files, some effort
  should be made to reduce the size of data files:

      * Compress data using one of python's built-in compression libraries
        if this results in significantly smaller files
      * Commit data to the tree only once. If a PR contains multiple copies
        of data files in its commit history, then it may be squash-merged 
        to minimize expansion.

* Demos should, whenever possible, only depend on VisPy and NumPy.
